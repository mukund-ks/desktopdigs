# DesktopDigs
An In-Game Lens Exhibit.

## About

DesktopDigs is my personal creative haven, where I proudly display a collection of carefully curated snapshots captured from the immersive worlds of the games I cherish.

Beyond being a showcase for my in-game photography, DesktopDigs serves as a personal playground for my journey into Full-Stack Development. Here, I'm not only refining my coding skills but also exploring the intricate balance between aesthetics and functionality.
